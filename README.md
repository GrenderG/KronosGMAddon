# Kronos-GM-Addon
Vanilla Wow 1.12.1 GM Addon built around Kronos-WoW.com Core.

### Requirments
Ace2

### Information
This addon was build for use on the Kronos-WoW.com Vanilla World of Warcraft Private server. 
The Addon will most likely need to be altered to work for other servers as some commands are custom for Kronos core code.

For Example:

* Ticket Reading most likely will not work on other servers without changing what System Text the addon scans chat for.(Each servers ticket wording is different)

* The Player Info Section Will most likely not work without changing what chat outputs the addon scans chat for. (Each Server Shows /who and .pinfo information slightly different)

* Any chat filter options are custom to Kronos only.

* Fingerprint commands are custom Kronos old code.
